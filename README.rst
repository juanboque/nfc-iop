**NFC Device Interoperability Test Scenarios**

-------

This is a documentation project to assemble and agree on
interoperability test scenarios for NFC Devices, think of
smartphones. By nature this work is incomplete and expected to
continuously update as specifications, device capabilities, and use
cases evolve over time.

The documentation is written in reStructuredText and can be build
using Sphinx. A usually up-to-date HTML version is available at
http://nfciop.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.
