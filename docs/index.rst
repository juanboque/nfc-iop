NFC Forum Bluetooth Connection Handover Test Cases Specification
================================================================

This documentation proposes interoperability test scenarios for NFC
Devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other comparably
capable computing devices. NFC Devices that would typically be
characterized as embedded or functionally restricted devices are not
subject of the proposal.

All interoperability test scenarios are intended to be run by a |DIT|
against a |DUT| and for any given pairing of *Device A* and *Device B*
to be executed once with *Device A* as the |DIT| and *Device B* as the
|DUT|, and once with *Device A* as the |DUT| and *Device B* as the
|DIT|.
