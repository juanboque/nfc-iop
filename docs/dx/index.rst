Small Data Exchange
===================

NFC isn't a fast data carrier - it's beauty lies in the explicitness
of interaction that a user conciously performs when touching two
devices. But 424 kbps physical speed and a transmit time of about 1
second are good enough to transfer about 20 kilobyte of user data with
the Simple NDEF Exchange Protocol (SNEP) or other protocols that run
on top of the Logical Link Control Protocol (LLCP).
